# TheAtheneum
For completed side projects done outside of school. 

I am using this repository to compile all of the completed programs I create thourgh tutorials, books, or ad hoc projects done outside of the classroom. 

Projects:

Shapes! - This was done after watching a COMP 4300 class assignment video on YouTube and creating my own version of the assignment with modifications

FromTheDeep - First assignment from Beginning C++ Game Programming, but added some original artwork

Zombie Arena! - Third assignment from Beginning C++ Game Programming, with a few minor adjustment to improve gameplay
